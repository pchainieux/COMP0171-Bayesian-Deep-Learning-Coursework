## Coursework 2

**Grade:** 100.00 / 100.00

### Commentary

- **Part 1:** 17/19  
  *Feedback:* Good implementation. For the free response, partial credit was given; generally good, but consider: if SGLD fails, wouldn’t it also end up mostly sampling near a mode — much like a Laplace approximation? What else is different here?

- **Part 2:** 13/11  
  *Feedback:* Great job.
